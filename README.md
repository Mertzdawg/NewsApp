# NewsApp

Create a small news application that makes use of the https://newsapi.org/ API for retrieving news data. The application should be able to show a scrollable list of news stories with a corresponding image. Further, it should be possible to tap a news story and have it open in an in-app webview. 

Moreover, the project should make use of the following concepts / libraries:
* The MVVM architecture
* Retrofit for networking
* RecyclerView for the list of news stories
* Kotlin instead of Java
* Use of Conductor
* Glide for image handling

For bonus points, the project can make use of the following (this isnâ€™t required, but it refers to technologies we use at Adapt):
* RxJava
